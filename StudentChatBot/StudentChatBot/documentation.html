                <p>So you're a proud new owner/contributor to teHelperBot2017. Use this guide for information on deploying,

                <h2>Basics &amp; Deployment</h2>
                <p>teHelperBot lives on Azure, while the database lives on an AppHarbor SQLServer database.</p>
                <p>teHelperBot uses the Microsoft Bot Framework, which is built on an API. You can manage the bot API via the 
                <a href="https://dev.botframework.com" target="_blank">Bot Framework</a> website. If you want to add the bot to additional channels, 
                such as Slack or Facebook Messenger, you would turn these channels on via the Bot Framework interface.</p>
                <p>Luis AI is also used via API integration. The API call is made from <span class="helper-tag">SearchDialog.cs</span>. 
                You can read more about Luis in the <a href="#luis">Luis AI section</a>.</p>
                <p>Packages Used:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Microsoft Bot Framework</li>
                    <li>Bootstrap (CSS)</li>

                <a name="resourceManager"></a>
                <h2>teHelper Resource Manager</h2>
                <p>The teHelper Resource Manager is an easy way to add and update resources in the database. You can easily attach and 
                remove keywords to any resource, whether Pathway or Technical.</p>
                <p>The teHelper Resource Manager must be run locally because there are no users or security in place. It syncs with the live 
                AppHarbor database, so any changes you make while running locally will update instantly.</p>

                <a name="luis"></a>
                <h2>Luis AI API</h2>
                <p><a href="https://www.luis.ai/" target="_blank">Luis AI</a> understands what a user is asking for (their intent), 
                though doesn't understand the keywords the user is looking for. It looks for the basic structure of a question/prompt/statement 
                made by the user (called an utterance), and knows what part of the sentence is the keyword (called an entity) we need to 
                search the database for.</p>
                <p>To add new utterances, you'll need to log in to your Luis AI account (via Microsoft account). Navigate to Intents > listen for keyword 
                and then you can add new utterances and mark the part of the sentence that represents the keyword.</p>
                <p>We've had difficulty in getting Luis to understand what a user is asking for if they only send the keyword ("variables" versus 
                "i need help with variables"). This may require training Luis to understand what to look for, though we're not sure.</p>
                <p>You can train, test, and manage the Luis API (which returns JSON) from the Publish App section of Luis.ai.</p>

                <a name="database"></a>
                <h2>Database</h2>
                <p>The database is currently hosted on AppHarbor on a SQLServer database. There's a seed/schema script included in the teHelper 
                capstone project <span class="helper-tag">database</span> folder. We recommend backing it up periodically, especially after 
                updating resources.</p>
                <p>We were not able to use Ninject or dependency injection in this application because of the differences between MVC and the Bot 
                Framework. If you need to change a source, you'll have to dive into the code to change the connection strings for each area that 
                talks with the DAL.</p>

                <a name="dialogs"></a>
                <h2>Dialog Stacks</h2>
                <p>The heart of teHelperBot lives in Dialogs. Each path of a conversation will roughly follow a dialog stack.</p>
                <p>The MessagesController calls the Root Dialog, which takes care of all possible paths of conversations.</p>
                <p>Reading through the code and seeing what different commands do is the best way to learn and modify the bot.</p>
                <p>Every dialog always starts in the <span class="helper-tag">StartAsync</span> method, and from there will travel through 
                various methods.</p>
                <p>The most common thing you'll do is update an existing menu, which should be under it's own method in a Dialog Prompt.</p>

                <a name="matchmaking"></a>
                <h2>Updating the Matchmaking Schedule</h2>
                <p>To update the files for the Matchmaking section of the teHelperBot you'll need to export as a tab-separated values file (.tsv) by going
                to File > Download As > .tsv file (last option) the following two files:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="helper-tag">Matchmaking Schedule - EXTERNAL - Schedule (by Student)</span> should be renamed 
                        <span class="helper-tag">MatchmakingScheduleByStudent.tsv</span> and placed in the 
                        <span class="helper-tag">StudentChatBot\StudentChatBot\Content</span> folder.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="helper-tag">Matchmaking - Company Emails</span> should be renamed 
                        <span class="helper-tag">MatchmakingCompanies.tsv</span> and also placed in the 
                        <span class="helper-tag">StudentChatBot\StudentChatBot\Content</span> folder.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Keeping the format (columns, spacing, etc) in each Google Sheets document is incredibly important.</p>
